MS1 New Rummikub 

We built a modified, one-player, version of the board game Rummikub.
The game involves 104 tiles, each of which has a color and number.
Once the game is started, 14 cards will be automatically drawn and 
will be displayed on the terminal.

Players begin with 14 tiles, and attempt to get rid of these tiles
by creating groups (sets of the same number but with different colors)
and runs (sets of increasing consecutive numbers all in the same color).

Currently, the player can’t use cards on the table to form sets. Since 
the goal of MS1 was to implement the logic behind the game, the table is
not currently visible to the player, only the player’s own hand can be seen.

How to set up the code: 

Download the zip file from CMS, and unzip using the command “unzip rummikub.zip”
Run “make build”
Begin the game by running “make play”

How to play: 

The player should choose to either play, draw or stop using the following commands. 

PLAY: A player submits either a group or a run with the verb play followed by 
either run or group and a list of cards. For each card, the player should enter 
the card's number, color, and index. A lookup of the indices can be found here:

For a run, the player should enter cards in increasing numbers. All commands must 
be in lowercase alphanumeric characters. Commands are case-sensitive.

Example commands: 
   play group 1 black 0 1 blue 26 1 orange 52
   play run 10 blue 35 11 blue 36  12 blue 37
 
DRAW: A player draws a card.  [Draw] takes no object. 
Example command:
          draw

STOP: A player exits the game engine with this verb. [Stop] takes no object.
Example command:
    stop

Once the player inputs a command, updated cards in the player's hand will
be displayed on the terminal. If the player runs out of cards in their hand,
it would say “Illegal” and prompt the player to enter a new command. 
Implementing ending the game is in a later milestone, so right now, the game does not end.
